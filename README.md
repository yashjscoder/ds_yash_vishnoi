# 📈 Trader Performance Analysis and Predictive Signal Generation

## 🌟 Project Abstract

This project presents a rigorous quantitative analysis to uncover high-alpha trading strategies within volatile cryptocurrency markets. By integrating historical trade execution data with external market sentiment indicators—specifically the **Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index (FGI)**—we employed advanced statistical and machine learning techniques to achieve three primary goals: **trader segmentation**, **strategy validation**, and **predictive signal generation**. The output is a robust, data-driven framework for optimizing capital allocation and execution timing based on empirical evidence of market psychology.

## ⚙️ Analytical Workflow: A Multi-Stage Pipeline

The analysis was executed in a sequential, four-phase process detailed in the accompanying Jupyter Notebook ($\text{notebook\_1.ipynb}$).

### Phase 1: Data Preparation and Feature Engineering
1.  **Ingestion & Merging:** Historical trade records ($\text{PnL}$, $\text{Volume}$, $\text{Leverage}$) were ingested and time-aligned with external daily FGI sentiment scores.
2.  **Cleaning & Validation:** Outliers in profitability and volume were systematically identified and neutralized to ensure robust modeling inputs.
3.  **Feature Creation:** Engineered features included $\text{Return on Investment (ROI)}$, $\text{Leverage Efficiency}$, and categorical time indicators ($\text{Hour of Day}$, $\text{Day of Week}$).

### Phase 2: Trader Segmentation (Unsupervised Learning)
1.  **Metrics Generation:** Trader-specific aggregate metrics (e.g., Average $\text{PnL}$, $\text{Total Volume}$, $\text{Overall Win Rate}$) were calculated.
2.  **Clustering:** K-Means clustering was applied to these metrics to group traders into distinct behavioral clusters.
3.  **Cluster Validation:** The **Elbow Method** and silhouette scores were used to determine the optimal number of clusters, resulting in the identification of a single, highly profitable **Top Performer Cluster**.

### Phase 3: Strategy Validation and Predictive Signal Generation
1.  **Contrarian Alpha Test:** The Top Performer Cluster's profitability was isolated and compared across different FGI sentiment states ($\text{Fear}$ vs. $\text{Greed}$) to validate the presence of a **contrarian strategy**.
2.  **Transition Matrix:** A matrix was calculated to determine the average profitability for trades initiated following every possible **FGI sentiment transition** (e.g., $\text{Neutral}$ to $\text{Fear}$), isolating the most impactful shifts as high-confidence predictive signals.

### Phase 4: Temporal Optimization
1.  **Time-Based Aggregation:** Trade performance was aggregated by both the **hour of the day** and the **day of the week**.
2.  **Optimal Window Extraction:** This analysis pinpointed the specific hours and days that consistently yielded the highest average profitability, allowing for the optimization of execution timing.

## 🔑 Qualitative Findings (Strategy Insights)

The analysis yielded clear, non-numerical conclusions that form the basis of the final trading recommendations:

* **Dominant Strategy:** The overwhelming majority of the system's alpha is generated by the Top Performer Cluster, whose strategy is **fundamentally contrarian**. They exhibit significantly higher profitability during periods of market **Fear** compared to periods of **Greed**, where performance often dips into negative territory.
* **High-Confidence Signal:** The highest average profit is associated with trades initiated during a specific **sentiment shift** (e.g., a transition from one state to another). This indicates that the *change* in market psychology is a more powerful predictor than the static state itself.
* **Execution Timing:** There are clear, consistent **temporal windows** (both hourly and daily) that exhibit superior trading performance compared to the overall average. Focusing execution during these windows provides a definitive edge.
